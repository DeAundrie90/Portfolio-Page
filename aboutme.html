        INTRODUCTION
      </h1>
      <p>
      Well, let see: My name is De'Aundrie Howard. I find myself getting many nicknames such as "Dr.Dre," "Dre," "Andre," "D," and whatever else name they could conjour up with. I am starting to think they just don't want to say my full name - let alone spell it. I am from Fort Worth, Texas. Born and <sup>Raised</sup>. I am currently working two jobs, part-time father (she lives with her mother), and an advocate dream seeker.

        <p> Every since I was a little whippersnapper I have dabbled in computer electronics, but mainly on the hardware side. I have never really ventured out into the software side until my early college years as technology started to advance more rapidly. After my first year of college, I decided to do some self-taught tutorials on Dreamweaver and creating a website. This was due to the fact I wanted a site to host all my <em>cool</em> videos and recordings.
